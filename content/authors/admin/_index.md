This site is under construction! 

I﻿ am a PhD student broadly interested in the scientific philosophy and the inner workings of a process called 'life'. I'm working with [Professor Sara Walker](http://emergence.asu.edu/) at the [Beyond Center](http://beyond.asu.edu/) and the department of Physics at ASU.

Understanding how complex systems (as complex as life itself) emerge in a simple universe intrigues me. I am using Assembly Theory and the general theory of Genotype-phenotype (GP) maps to address this question. I believe this shall also broaden our understanding of the theory of Evolution, the pre, the post and the plus  to the Darwinian evolution.
